Problem Statement : Implement a solution for Finding a summation of elements from a matrix.

Example: Accept a 2D matrix dimension. Populate using random number [non-zero]

Accept any five dimension values from the user for example [1,1] [4,10] 10,7] [15,3] [20,18] .Check the region covered by these points in the matrix.Calculate the boundary by either considering all points or ignoring few points which may not come on boundary [convex hull]. Find sum of elements in the region.
